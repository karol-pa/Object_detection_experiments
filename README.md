# Object_detection_experiments
In this little exercise project, objects are detected in an image of a game shelf using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It identifies video game cases, and presents them along with their coordinates and probabilities. Additionally, it extracts the text from the case spines, which can be used for automated cataloguing.
